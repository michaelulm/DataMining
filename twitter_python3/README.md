# Twitter Data Mining

## Preparation

1. Create Twitter Account
2. Register as a [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/)
3. Create a [Twitter App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)
4. Go to your App by [https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/YOUR-APP-ID](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/YOUR-APP-ID)
5. Take care you have minimum **read and write permissions** to your app
6. Get **Keys and Tokens** for your implementation (currently no need for app login needed)


## First Steps

### Single Tweet
- Create some tweets by [twitter](https://www.twitter.at) itself 
- try to find out your tweet id
- implement a small app to load your last tweet by this id

### Update Status
- implement a small app to write a tweet to your twitter stream
- check if the tweet is succesful posted at your stream
- add a terminal input for new messages
- send several tweets by your small demo app

### Retweet other Tweets
- search for some new friends on twitter
- find any tweet by [twitter](https://www.twitter.at) itself 
- try to retweet this tweet
- also try to 
	- retweet any tweet twice
	- retweet a tweet of a retweeted tweet, which you already has retweeted
- go back to the first task and read your retweeted tweet, analyse the **tweet object**

### Favorite Tweet
- choose a random tweet and copy tweet id
- implement a small app which favorite this selected tweet

### Query the Twitter Stream API
- think about any topic you are interested
- query the twitter stream for any selected topic, e.g. Education
- try to search for popular tweets about this topic, how you could filter "**popular tweets**"?


## And now, Catch me if you can!
